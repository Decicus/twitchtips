The most confusing part for most is setting up the donation “button”. This tutorial will go through the entire process from logging into PayPal to getting your donation panel set up. What you need in order to follow this tutorial is as follows: From here under “Selling online” you’ll see the option “PayPal Buttons”. To the right you’ll either see “Get started” or “Update”. Click this link and you’ll be taken to the page where you can create a new “button”. If you haven’t already created a PayPal button you’ll be taken straight to the button creation process, however if you already have an existing button you’ll be shown a list of all your currently active buttons. To being the creation process click the “Create new button” link to the right of the listed buttons already there. Now that we’re onto the button creation process be sure to choose “Donations” from the button type drop-down. Give your self an “Organization name / service” (i.e. your Twitch channel name or what-not) and then scroll down to the currency drop-down. Here you can select your native currency if you so wish to (USD, GBP etc). There are more options you can modify which I won’t go into on this post but may do in the future. Feel free to take your time and customize your donation button / process as much as you’d like to.  Once you’re done fiddling with the settings and what-not, click the “Save changes” button at the bottom and you’ll be taken to a page that gives you the website embed code and the direct email url. We want the e-mail one so click on the e-mail tab. Inside the text-box will be a link, this link is what we’ll link to an image on our Twitch channel so that people can click on the image and be taken to the PayPal checkout page so that they can donate to you. From here go to your Twitch channel (i.e. twitch.tv/yourname), scroll down and look for the “edit panels” toggle and the click “on” option. Now you can add a new panel or modify an existing panel if you so wish, simply click the “Add image” button, select your pre-made or pre-gathered donation button / image and then put the url you got from the e-mail tab in PayPal in the “Image links to” field. Give your panel a name such as “tip jar”, “donations” or whatever you want to call it, submit the panel and you’re done! If this was hard for you to follow then feel free to check out the tutorial video I made on YouTube a while back that goes through this exact process, some might find it a lot easier to follow!  Please take note: PayPal’s “donation” button is designed for non-profit organizations. If you raise over $10,000 they will require proof you’re a non-profit organization.

Well, here’s how to fix that issue! The reason(s) you may be getting this issue is due to one of the following; Let’s start with the simple stuff, depending on the browser you’re using follow the relevant instructions below: Go to: Settings > Privacy > Content settings > JavascriptFrom here make sure “Allow all sites to run JavaScript” is selectedOnce you’re sure, click “Done”   In the URL / Address bar type: about:config and proceed to press enter You may see a “warranty” screen, simply click the button saying “I’ll be careful, I promise!”Once you’re in, type “javascript.enabled” into the search bar below the URL bar Once you see the “javascript.enabled” preference, make sure the assigned value is “true” and not “false”. If it’s false simply right click and hit the “toggle option”.  Once you’ve made sure JavaScript is enabled on your browser and you’re still getting the grey screen, its time to check extensions!Firstly, lets test something - in your browser open up an incognito window (don’t lie, you know what that is) and try loading Twitch. Do you still get the same error?If so your problem isn’t likely to be an extension (make sure by checking extensions the browser allows to run in incognito mode - if you see no active extensions in incognito move down to the next section).If you did manage to load Twitch successfully then your perpetrator is likely an extension, go to your extension listings and make sure to disable all extensions.Now try to load Twitch again, if it works you can begin to enable extensions one by one until you find the one that is causing the issue and remove it from your installed extensions.Still not working, lets move onto anti-virus / security software potentially blocking JS from being executed etc   There’s hundreds of anti-virus and security software programs out there so it’s practically impossible for me to list every single one with detailed instructions on what to do.Simply, you’re looking for browser, network or web protection that allows you to configure the level of security the software will attempt to abide by.If you can, try to disable any firewall or web protection for a couple of minutes and try loading Twitch, still getting the issue? If not then you’re perpetrator is somewhere within those security settings, fiddle around and let us know how you fixed it so we can keep others up to date!   The part we all didn’t want to get to; Malware can be very annoying, sophisticated and a general pain in the ass to deal with. However, we have some wonderful tools available to us!My advice is to install AdwCleaner and Malwarebytes and scan for any malware / adware or general horribleness lurking on your PC.Below are links to said tools, please let us know in the comments if you do manage to find anything so we can keep others up to date!   Recently its been noted that DNS issues on the user end may cause an issue reaching the CDN for Twitch. If you already know how to altar your DNS you can simply change to either of the following DNS providers. 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 208.67.222.222 208.67.220.220 If you’re not sure on how to change your DNS settings simply follow guide provided on Twitch’s help desk located here (PC) or this Mac guide here (Mac).

That feeling of being a part of something special with your fellow broadcasters.  A sense of belonging sharing a common bond within the vast awesomeness of Twitch. But what purpose do they really serve and how can they help you as a streamer? Let’s get started with the basics first though! A Twitch team is a grouping of streamers who voluntarily join upon being invited by a team maker. Typically these people have a common goal, mindset, game, or approach to streaming that binds them together under their team banner.  It’s a multi-way endorsement that says to Twitch viewers: these streams I approve of and they approve of me, so check them out! If someone is a part of at least one team, you’ll be able to see this under their stream title. Like so: Teams can only be created by a partnered streamer (no sub button required!).  The partner emails partnersupport in order to request a team. Once approved, the partner can then go to;  Click “Edit” team (or just add your team url name to this: http://www.twitch.tv/team/YOURNAMEHERE/edit) and add members, manage the order in which members will appear, and add art to spiff the main-page up.  You can add a featured channel to this main-page, review the archives, as well as review stats and revenue for any team member that has enabled sharing these features. Nope! You are free to have as exclusive or as populated of a team as you like. Nope! Commit to a singular meaningful favorite or collect them like Pokémon. To join a team follow below instructions; The three options you also have are to share your stats (partner only), your revenue (advertising, partner only), and to set a certain team - if you’re part of more than one - as your featured team under your stream title. The revenue option allows the team owner to see your revenue if you are a Twitch Partner. However, your revenue remains tied to your account only and is not shared with the team owner or the team in any other way. To leave a team follow below instructions; (Note: read below for the social side of this action) There are finer points of team dynamics as well. Read on if you need more on the social aspects of being in or running a team. Some teams are not active in cross-promotion or pushing a particular brand. These sorts of teams are quite dormant for networking and therefore do not provide much benefit to the team members in terms of channel growth.  These sorts of teams might prefer to show an exclusive circle of friends or a collection of streamers under a network that are not tied together on any other aspect. Often though, to be in a team means you are there to promote your fellow team-mates as well as be promoted by them.  It’s a mutually beneficial sort of thing. I’d suggest you don’t expect much if you aren’t willing to pitch in. Remember, this micro-community only has as much value as you and your fellow team-mates place in it! From what I’ve seen, there are some people who stick to only one team and focus only on that. There are others who are in 3+ teams which all share roughly the same viewership; and in this sort of situation, most streamers in each team often play the same games.  Therefore, joining too many teams in the same game community is only cannibalizing your own cross-team exposure potential. At the same time, your channel shows up on more team pages and potentially brings more new eyes to your page. The choice is yours. There is no certain ‘right time’ to join a team. It’s entirely up to when you feel comfortable. If you’re thinking you wish to try for a career as a streamer, then you might want to be more careful and take longer to consider your options than if you merely enjoy streaming as a hobby.  Ask yourself a few simple questions before committing: do you know all of the streamers on the team? Do you have any personal discomfort with any current members? Do you enjoy watching most of the members? Are these other channels the sort you’d proudly send your own viewers to? Being on a team means to your viewers that you approve of the channels under the same team name. That depends on a few aspects of your channel and how much free time you have.  Managing a team doesn’t take THAT much extra work, but does take some, as you need to create and maintain relationships with the members you’ve invited (you should do this even if you’re just a member), help promote their streams and set an example for them (chances are they are all smaller than you if you’re the team creator), and of course, it’s best if you put effort into creating a logo and art for the main-page as well.  Art isn’t required, but if you want a professional team image, then you’ll prioritize getting branding done. But maybe you aren’t interested in doing all of that management or maybe you don’t feel it’s for you due to time requirements or whatever other reason. If that’s the case, then simply joining another team might be better for you.  Joining another team means you still ought to cross-promote and be considerate to your fellow team-mates, but there is far less work involved and less potential responsibility Or - if neither of these options appeal to you - you can simply ‘lonewolf’ it on Twitch and avoid teams altogether! There are small and big streamers that do not have a team and are not part of someone else’s. The choice is yours. Networking is possible even without joining a team anyhow - so don’t feel obligated for the sake of your channel. Remember that you are your brand on Twitch. Whatever manner you conduct yourself in might have an impact on your channel as a whole and might follow you for some time.  Clear and professional communication is best. I’d suggest messaging the team owner and leaving them a short and polite note that you appreciated your experience with the team but you feel it’s time to move on and you wish them the best. Easy peasy. This article was written by the wonderful Shannon (AKA: ShannonZKiller). I am the community manager/partner for a streamer named Sacriel, and am also a Twitch Admin.

They make mistakes, have a reaction time that massively exceeds the time a computer takes to react to messages written in chat and occasionally need some sleep. For this reason, so called “Chat moderation robots” or simply “bots” have been created by third party developers. These can perform basic moderation tasks, such as timing out users automatically if they use offensive words in chat, as well as custom chat commands, which make the bot respond with information if a command is posted in chat. For very small channels, with low amount of viewers, a bot is not necessary.  Having a bot in a channel that is live once a week and averages 3 viewers just wastes resources on the bot- and chat servers. If you do not have a lot of viewers, you will probably not be in the need of a bot – consider expanding your viewership and getting a bot when it becomes a necessity, for example, if spammers keep posing a problem, or people keep asking the same questions over and over, that is a definite sign you want a bot. Be careful with repeated commands however, if you are in a channel with 5 viewers and a bot keeps posting social media info every 2 minutes, that just gets obnoxious as time passes on. These questions are important to answer, yet impossible to answer completely. There is a wide range of bots and reasons why you want a bot. To address the first question, I will try to give an overview over the 3 most commonly used bots:   These bots are all similar, yet optimized for different use cases.  Every channel can use each of the bots, but properly deciding which bot to use can make your life on Twitch a lot easier.   While this does not hold true for every bot, most bots (including these three bots) can be controlled with commands that are posted in chat.  These commands usually take the form of For any bot, there are predefined commands, which allow you to make changes to commands and other settings the bot might provide.  Additionally, most bots allow for the creation of custom commands, which make the bot post a certain message in chat (see image below) and even have the bot automatically repeat the command to create a repeat the command every so often. The exact commands available differ greatly between the bots covered here, which is why I will not go into full detail about them - there are help pages and command lists for all of these bots. Additionally, some bots even have a graphical interface (“GUI” or “dashboard”) to control the bots. It simplifies the process of making changes to the bot without needing to know all the commands and how they work, since commands have to be entered exactly as they should to work properly, “something similar” will not be understood correctly by the bot. Nightbot is a bot that specializes in ease of use and fun features, and thus is especially useful for small channels, but there is no limit to the size of channel that can use Nightbot (the second biggest stream on Twitch even uses Nightbot). It uses a freemium model, providing basic functionality for free and removing limitations if you donate to the NightDev team. A full command list is found in the Nightbot dashboard.Most prominent features:  You can get Nightbot by creating an account at the Nightbot dashboard and clicking the “Join” button after logging in. Make sure to make Nightbot a moderator in your chat with   A bot designed for ease-of-use, with a high-level dashboard from which you can edit all of the bots settings. One of the biggest benefits is its extreme speed and reliability, built to prevent spam by timing out users fast enough that users don’t even get to see bad messages, instead of removing them after a short duration. It is free to use, but certain features and restrictions require payment.Partial list of features: To get Moobot, connect your Twitch account to the Moobot dashboard at http://twitch.moobot.tv/ A command list is found in the Moobot dashboard - however, you dont need that! Moobot can be entirely controlled via the dashboard. To use Moobot, you have to type Out of the 3 bots covered in this article, Xanbot is the only one that does not have a dashboard at the time of this write-down and is completely controlled by chat commands. However, it excels at moderation thanks to its support for regular expressions, which make it harder to use and therefore, more focused on advanced users, providing them with the most powerful tools to keep spam low. Xanbot is completely free to use for all users.Some of Xanbot’s features: You can get Xanbot by going to http://twitch.tv/xangold and typing !join in chat. Afterwards, add Xanbot as a moderator in your channel with A complete command list for Xanbot can be found at http://twitchtvchat.com/xanbotinfo.html Now that we have covered the most common bots on Twitch, what bot should you use? Does it need to be one of these 3? Both of these questions cannot be answered definitively. All of these bots are under constant development, improving their stability and feature set. If you have the necessity to add a bot to your stream, you can try them out, or just use whatever bot you know best. If you are new to bot usage, it is definitely suggested to use Nightbot or Moobot, which have a lot of similarities in their usage.  Nobody can tell you which bot to use in general, it completely depends on what you what the bot to do for you. But all of the bots above are great if used correctly. Alternatively, there are other bots which have not been handled here, examples would be DeepBot, Ackbot, and custom made bots, often just made for a single channel. In a lot of cases, these aren’t provided free of charge however or pose the problem of hosting – they require a server to be run on. Using a bot can be complicated and hard to people who are new to moderation.  Thankfully, there are a lot of people giving support for the bot you decide to use! In the case of the 3 bots listed above, you can find support forNightbot: Use the support form on the Nightbot dashboard: http://nightbot.tv/supportMoobot: Tweet at https://twitter.com/TwitchTVMoobot or ask in http://twitch.tv/Moobot, I sometimes read that chatXanbot: Tweet at https://twitter.com/Xangold, https://twitter.com/XanbotUpdates or just ask in http://twitch.tv/Xangold, I usually stick around.    However, keep in mind: we are all volunteers and may not have time to help at all points in time. Rule no.1 about getting support is patience. Leaving a support channel after a minute will most likely not give you an answer. I myself give a lot of support for the bots I know well, mainly Xanbot and Moobot. Feel free to PM me on Twitch if you have specific questions!   While the image above might be slightly overdone, it is a common thing that I regularly see in a lot of streams - people overuse a bots features, in a way that makes chat dominated by a bot. This is one of the key reasons why it is recommended not to use a bot for small channels. A good rule you can apply to autoreplies and similar: if more than one automatically repeated bot message is visible at a single point in time, you are overdoing it. Keep spam by the bot low. Have it post social media info if you feel like it, but do not overdo it.Create custom commands! If a certain question gets asked very frequently, just make a command that provides the answer.Get support! If you are unsure or new to bots and need help setting one up, there is always people with more experience than you who can help you out. (See part 5) Make your chat dominated by a bot (or several bots). People coming your channel want to interact with you, not some computer program.Rely on the bot for moderation. As soon as your stream gets going, make sure to (at least almost) always have moderators in your channel. While well-tweaked bot settings can essentially automatically moderate chat as well as you might like, there is always things that might not be caught. Certain situations might require someone to adjust bot settings. For most bots, these settings can be changed by moderators, which makes having a moderator available very important at times.Have too restrictive settings on the bot. Why would a channel with 20 viewers have every person who posts a link timed out? If there ever is a wave of spambots going on, the bot settings can be easily changed.Make all commands mod-only, unless you are a huge channel. Why? If you have a command that displays important information and someone asks for that info, a commonly seen thing is that channel regulars will ask the moderators to post the command! In what way would that be less annoying than giving them the ability to post the command themselves? A good solution to conquer bot spam in large channels is to make commands subscriber only.

In its basic form it’s essentially a group of nodes (computers) sending useless data to your network and causing issues. Believe it or not there are other users out there that will attempt to attack you with said method in order to generally annoy and harass you. Such attacks can cause your connection to drop (for extended periods or continously dropping ever x seconds depending on the strength of the attack). In some communities DDoS’ing is widely used and we want to help you ensure you protect yourself as best as possible with what resources are available to you. In theory this guide cannot guarantee you’ll be safe from said attacks, but it’ll teach you how to prevent them as best as possible.  So, essentially for someone to attack you or your network they’ll need an IP address, think of it like your internet street address - it’s unique to you (unless you’re using a public accessible WiFi etc). Now generally, users IP addresses are supposed to be hidden or out of the general public view however there is multiple “exploits” throughout online services that allow others to extract the information they need, some of the popular methods are listed below: There’s also more methods but they’re generally not much of an issue in the gaming community etc. For now we’ll go over the 3 listed on how they work and how you can best protect yourself. Some services such as Skype are known as VOIP applications, it basically means voice over the internet (IP). Now you may think due to Skype being such a big name you’d be safe - you’re not. Skype has a tendency to allow users to resolve your Skype handle and return an IP address. In the past this was extremely easy to do to anyone since anyone could query any handle and return an IP address - however since then they have added in a feature that disallows direct connections to users not on your Skype friends list.  Generally this enough for most people if they keep their Skype extremely private. But of course some people like to add anyone and everyone and even with the direct connection blocking enabled users on your friends lists can still resolve your IP address by simply querying it.  What’s the fix to this you may ask? There’s no real fix - you simply add an extra line of defense, in this case a HTTP / SOCKS5 proxy (you’ll want to prioritize SOCKS5 > HTTP). Okay, so how do I setup this proxy? Firstly you’ll want to direct yourself to Skype and click the Tools drop down, from there click Options and head to Advanced > Connection. You should see a screen like what is show below: Firstly you’re going to want to go ahead and enable “Allow direct connections to your contacts only”. This will present users outside of your Skype friends lists from querying your IP address. If you’d like to know how to set up  a proxy for your Skype account or other internet services, simple follow this guide written by Fire. If you don’t wish to set up a proxy for Skype or other services you use we highly recommend you keep your contacts absolutely limited to people you know you can trust. If you add them to your contacts and they have malicious intentions there’s no stopping them from resolving your handle if you don’t have a proxy set up. It is also noteworthy you can use a VPN (virtual private network) to mask your actual IP address however VPN’s generally mask all of your traffic rather than just Skype for example. A lot of VPN services have been banned through other users abusing them. Unfortunately it happens, there are people out there that will exploit, abuse and hack into services which you may use, there’s almost nothing you can do about it - it’s just part of the internet in general. Unfortunately individuals that do decide to follow such activities also release privately held information on a regular basis such as databases and server logs which may contain your account details (username, e-mail, password hash, last used IP address, IP address registered with etc). This information can and will be abused by individuals that stumble upon it. The best ways to combat this are listed below: Other than the tips stated above, there’s not much else you can do - be careful what information you share and who you share it with. Knowledge is power and people will abuse that if they can. Honeypots in their purest form are websites, servers and services used to bait users into using them and then recording what they do, their information etc. Essentially Honeypots are entities which you don’t want to be on the wrong side of. Their sole intention is information gathering. Why is this important to me you may ask? Well, unfortunately again there are users out there that will set up such services and attempt to bait you into clicking / using them such as IP grabbing websites, phishing websites and just general malicious services. If someone you don’t know (or in some cases do know) asks you to visit a website, connect to a server that you don’t recognize, think twice. What they’re sending you could be a trap, do some research beforehand if you’re curious but again, be careful. I’m not trying to suggest you be 100% paranoid about anything and everything people send you, but think twice before following through. It only takes one mistakes for them to cause you a tonne of grief. The Internet can be a scary place and as a streamer you may be targeted for whatever reason is humanly possible to comprehend. Yes, it sucks and it’s unfortunate - but don’t get too down on it. Stay safe online, protect yourself and if you’re having problems with someone harassing you on Twitch send a report of them following this method."},{"title":"Multi-display Broadcasting (OBS Guide)","url":"/multi-display/","date":"2014-06-14 00:00:00 +0100","categories":[],"body":"This tutorial will guide you through the process of how you can use OBS (Open Broadcast Software) to broadcast using multiple displays ie: (Nvidia Surround/Eyefinity). This is an example of how the default settings using Game Capture in OBS would appear to you and your viewers. Using this guide will allow you to broadcast your center display. Step 1: Open OBS. At this point you should also open up the game you plan to broadcast and/or record and alt+tab out. Step 2: Click on Settings > Video. Step 3: Enter the Custom Resolution Size as your monitor size. In my case, 1920x1080. You can also choose your Resolution Downscale too. Step 4: Click on OK. Step 5: Right click in the Sources box and click Add > Game Capture. Step 6: Click on Application drop-down menu and choose the game you wish to broadcast. You may need to click on refresh if you’ve only just openend a game. Step 7: Click OK. Step 8: Now let’s see how it looks. Click on Preview. So now as you can see we’re now capturing the middle display. For the purpose of this tutorial I have Minecraft in window mode but it will work correctly in fullscreen. But you might want to remove the black bars. Step 9: Click on the the Source you added. Then click Edit Scene. Step 10: Point your cursor to the very edge of the game capture seeing the red border liness. While holding Shift. Drag your mouse down until you’ve filled the black bars. Repeat the process for the top. And there you have it. If you followed these instructions correctly you should now be able to start broadcasting in a multi-display configuration (Nvidia Surround, Eyefinity Setup). This article was written by Sammy.

Before we continue, please make sure you have each of these:  If 75% of your upload speed equates to 3400kbps, (which is the maximum Twitch will take), then you can set your upload speed to that. Be warned however that many people cannot watch a stream with that high bit rate. For new streamers, a good balance between quality and watchability is 2000kbps. You will also need to take into consideration your own internet upload speed. If your maximum is 2mbps(2000kbps) then you may want to set your upload to 1500kbps. Intel:   AMD:   Due to the low speed/IPC(Instructions per clock) of AMD CPU’s, it is generally not recommended to stream with a dual core or lower.   NOTE: Any X264 preset beyond slow will provide for very little image quality gain and exponential CPU usage increase. We do not recommend going above Medium unless you have a monster CPU or extreme over clock.   Do NOT touch any of the other settings unless you have extensive knowledge of X264, OBS and video encoding, or if you are having issues and have been instructed so on the OBS forums.

These are the usual things trolls and scammers use to convince people to listen to them.  Often, this is used at the start of the troll and is said to be a consequence of a virus. Sometimes, the fact that there is no sound can be true. Make sure that there is sound on your stream before taking action.    This is usually telling people that System 32 is a virus and that you should delete it immediately. Trolls also spam ‘message deleted by system32’.  If you did not know, System 32 is the folder that keeps your Windows OS installation. If you delete this folder, you have practically deleted your computer.  Never edit stuff in this type of folder unless you are sure of what you are doing.  Before you saw trolls raiding channels, you would hope that someone who was told to pour milk in their console’s fan vents would have thought this was a bad idea. Sadly, that isn’t true.  No matter who tells you it does, pouring rice into your hard drive does not stop a static sound. Please, make sure you know what you are doing before doing things to the inside of machines and ignore what they are saying. Here we have the most common attack. Usually, someone will add you on Skype and ask for your stream key. Don’t give it to them. Otherwise, you may find something you don’t want being streamed to your channel. Instead, block them. Users often have offensive usernames and comments when they are trolling, usually racist ones. If you see a large number of offensive users gathering, be ready for what has been explained here. Lot’s of people have Skype. But most don’t know how dangerous it can be. If someone is able to get your Skype Name, it is very easy for them to get your IP. This can then result in DDoS attacks (lots of traffic being sent to your IP that may result in your stream doing offline).  For protection, make sure to set up a proxy following this existing guide. You may also get random friend requests from people who claim they are Support Staff. Twitch never offers assistance over Skype and you should therefore not comply. The main way trolls get people to listen is through pretending to be Staff. The only way a user can be considered Official is if they have one of these badges to represent what they do. You can also use the existing user checker.  If their type is “user”, they are not official. Some people often mistake @TwitchSupport Volunteers and other users for an official representative of Twitch, they are not. In addition, do not give impersonators moderator powers.  Some streamers do this and then anyone that tried to stop the streamer pouring cereal in a disc tray would be banned instantly. If you find something like this, you pretty much have the full package.  Reset everything immediately, most importantly passwords and stream keys.  Ban them from your channel. Using /subscribers can be a good way to stop chat while the issue blows over. Also, make sure to report them.  Stay safe!
