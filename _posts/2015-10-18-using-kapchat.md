## Adding to Stream
Adding KapChat couldn't be easier with common streaming software. 

### OBS
Head over to the [KapChat](https://nightdev.com/kapchat/) page and click the green install button.

<br>Kapchat uses a CLR Browser plugin which has been added with a batch file to make the install easier. After downloading, unzipping the file, install the plugin by double clicking the install.bat file. 

<br>After installing the OBS browser plugin you now get to create your chat display. Clicking next on the KapChat Installation will bring you to a page with all sorts of customization. 

 - Username: This is the channel in which the chat will be taken from. **Use the channel name and not the Twitch link.**
 - Chat Fade: The checkbox enables or disables the chat fade option which will fade out messages over a select amount of time. This feature is very useful if you don't want chat lines stuck there until someone sends a message.
 - Chat Fade Length: In seconds the default time is 30 seconds, feel free to play around with these time settings. If the Chat Fade checkbox is unchecked you can ignore this setting.
 - Show Bots: By default KapChat ignores bots. Custom bots can be added in the [BTTV Manager Page](https://manage.betterttv.net/channel), common bots (e.g. nightbot, moobot, xanbot) will already be recognized and do not need to be added. **Checking this will show all bot messages.**
 - Chat Theme: Select a chat theme from the list of 8. You can preview the display by clicking the "preview" button.

<br>When all the settings are to your liking you can continue. 

<br>A hosted URL will be generated and this will be copied to OBS.

<br>To display:<br>
Add a new source for obs and select "CLR Browser", give it a name of your choosing.

 - URL: Paste the Hosted URL generated by the KapChat page into the URL textbox. 
 - Dimensions:  If you're unsure of a size NightDev suggests a `height of 600` and a `width of 300`. You can then edit these to your liking and placement in your overlay.

<br>You now have a chat overlay in your stream! 

<br>If you ever need to customize any of the main features (e.g Chat Fade, Theme) head back to the [KapChat](https://nightdev.com/kapchat/) site and get a new Hosted URL and replace the old URL in your source.

### OBS MultiPlatform
OBS MultiPlatform Brower Plugin can be found [here](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/browser-plugin.115/) and contains an install guide. 

### XSplit
XSplit has a built in web plugin so there is no need to download anything. 

<br>Complete the same steps in the OBS guide skipping everything OBS related, and get the Hosted Link. 

<br>In XSplit navagate to Add -> Other -> Webpage URL. And paste the generated URL into the popout box. 

<br>From there you can edit the size and placement within xsplit.

----------

### Custom CSS (Advanced)
If the default themes don't have something your looking for you can change them using Custom CSS. **Custom CSS is for advanced users and Nightdev will not offer support for CSS related issues.**

<br>Nightdev has provided CSS selectors for people to improve upon on. They can be found on the 4th page of the install directions.

<br>To access on OBS, click on the CSS tab at the top of the CLR Browser settings.

<br>To access on XSplit, right-click the webpage source -> Enable Custom CSS Checkbox on HTML section -> Edit CSS.
